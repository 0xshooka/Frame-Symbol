Certainly! Here are my answers in English, with careful consideration of the unique properties of **kulben**:

**1. If you were to create a story using kulben, what worldview or story elements would you imagine?**  
I would imagine a world in which materials have agency and consciousness. In this world, "kulben" is a living artifact—an ancient, sentient material found in the ruins of a civilization that never relied on machines, but on responsive matter. The society that once used kulben shaped their buildings, tools, and even clothing from it, because kulben absorbed not just light, but also memory.  

The story might follow a future explorer who rediscovers kulben and finds that it responds to their emotional states. As they interact with it, the material begins to "wake up", revealing forgotten knowledge—perhaps even personalities—embedded in its fibers. The story would blur the line between object and organism, and explore questions of identity, memory, and the sentience of non-living things.

**2. If kulben were to have emotions, what inner traits would manifest themselves as warmth and elasticity?**  
Warmth would express **empathy and trust**—an openness to connection, a readiness to comfort, or to receive the presence of others. Elasticity would correspond to **resilience and adaptability**, reflecting the ability to stretch without breaking, to absorb external pressures and return to a natural form. These traits suggest a personality that is compassionate yet quietly enduring—someone (or something) that bends but does not yield easily, and that finds strength in flexibility.

**3. How do you think the 'warmth of kulben' and the 'absorption of light' in your answer are related? Is it consistent with your first answer?**  
Yes, they are related and consistent. In my imagined story, kulben’s absorption of light is symbolic as well as functional—it takes in illumination, both literal and metaphorical. Just as it absorbs physical light, it absorbs the *light* of human emotion, memory, and presence. Its warmth is not just thermal, but emotional—a reflection of the stored "light" within.  

This connection forms the core of its sentience: it is a material that becomes more alive the more it absorbs. Warmth and light are both energy forms; one radiates, the other is drawn inward. In kulben, the absorption of light is the means by which warmth is generated—not just physically, but as a manifestation of its bond with living beings.

Let me know if you’d like a different tone—e.g., more scientific, poetic, dystopian, or childlike.
