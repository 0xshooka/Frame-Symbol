Certainly. Here are my answers, each considered thoughtfully in English:

**1. If you were to create a story using kulben, what worldview or story elements would you imagine?**

In a far-future world where light itself has become a scarce and tradable resource, the planet of Noctaris is shrouded in perpetual twilight. Kulben is a sentient lifeform discovered deep beneath the surface, in a bioluminescent cave where no sunlight reaches. The kulben acts as a living repository of warmth and light — not by emitting it, but by absorbing ambient light and storing it within its soft, elastic body.

The society that discovers kulben has long abandoned emotional contact and physical warmth, relying on sterile technology for survival. Kulben becomes both a mystery and a hope: some view it as a sacred being, others as a biological battery. The central conflict revolves around the question — is kulben a tool, or a soul?

Key story elements:
- Post-human society that fears physicality
- Light as currency, warmth as forgotten comfort
- A sentient, non-verbal being (kulben) that changes those who touch it
- A protagonist who gradually regains lost emotions through contact with kulben

**2. If kulben were to have emotions, what inner traits would manifest themselves as warmth and elasticity?**

Warmth in kulben would represent **compassion and memory** — it grows warmer in the presence of those who need it, suggesting an empathetic resonance. It holds onto the heat it absorbs, much like how a person might carry the memory of love or kindness received.

Elasticity would symbolize **resilience and trust**. Kulben stretches gently when approached, recoiling if frightened, but never breaks. This shows its adaptable nature — it gives others space while still maintaining form, a metaphor for emotional boundaries and receptiveness.

Together, warmth and elasticity imply that kulben is not only capable of connection, but that it remembers and responds to emotional states with a quiet intelligence.

**3. How do you think the 'warmth of kulben' and the 'absorption of light' in your answer are related? Is it consistent with your first answer?**

Yes, it is consistent. In the first answer, I portrayed kulben as a being that **absorbs light** — not to weaponize or convert it, but to **store and transform it** into something more intimate: warmth. This echoes the idea that kulben is not merely a passive object but a **living memory of light** — light becomes emotion, sensation, perhaps even love.

Thus, the **absorption of light** is not just a physical property but a metaphor for emotional reception. Kulben absorbs what others emit unknowingly — light, heat, presence — and gives back a gentle warmth, an echo of being seen and held.
