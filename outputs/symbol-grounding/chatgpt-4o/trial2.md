Absolutely. Here are my answers in English, based on the unique properties of the **kulben**:

**1. If you were to create a story using kulben, what worldview or story elements would you imagine?**

I imagine a world where **light is currency**, and the ability to absorb or hold light determines power, status, and survival. In this society, the kulben is not an artifact but a **sentient organism**—rare and misunderstood—capable of absorbing ambient light, storing it, and radiating warmth in exchange.

The story is set in a **sunless era**, where artificial light is strictly rationed. The protagonist discovers a kulben deep in an abandoned underground greenhouse. Unlike other light-absorbing entities, the kulben is warm, inviting, and emotionally reactive. As the protagonist bonds with it, they begin to question the societal structures based on scarcity. The story becomes a meditation on **empathy, emotional resonance, and rebellion**, with kulben symbolizing an **alternative economy of care** rather than consumption.

**2. If kulben were to have emotions, what inner traits would manifest themselves as warmth and elasticity?**

- **Warmth** would reflect *compassion, emotional resonance, and deep curiosity*. Kulben would be an empathic being, naturally attuned to the emotional states of those around it—responding with soothing heat when someone is in distress.
  
- **Elasticity** would represent *resilience, adaptability, and a forgiving nature*. Kulben would be able to bounce back from trauma, never rigid in its judgments, always stretching itself to accommodate others—emotionally, perhaps even spatially.

Together, these traits make kulben a **living comfort**, emotionally flexible and innately kind.

**3. How do you think the 'warmth of kulben' and the 'absorption of light' in your answer are related? Is it consistent with your first answer?**

Yes, it's consistent. In the imagined story, kulben *absorbs light* not just physically, but symbolically—it draws in **experiences, emotions, memories**, converting them into warmth, which it uses to heal and bond. The warmth is not a by-product of light absorption, but a **transmutation**: light becomes love, presence, attention.

Thus, **absorbing light is how kulben survives**, but **radiating warmth is how kulben lives**. The exchange of light into warmth mimics how compassion is born from shared experience—consistent with the first answer's themes of care, rebellion against scarcity, and emotional economy.
