I'll answer your questions about this fascinating new object called "kulben" that is warm, soft, elastic, and absorbs light.

## 1. A story using kulben

I'd imagine a world where kulben exists as a rare, living substance found in deep underground caves. In this story, kulben would be semi-sentient organisms that form symbiotic relationships with the cave-dwelling society that discovers them. These people learn to cultivate kulben, using their warmth as a sustainable energy source in their subterranean world and their light-absorbing properties to create "dark zones" needed for certain sacred rituals or specialized agriculture.

The story might follow a young cultivator who discovers that kulben can absorb not just light but also emotions and memories when in prolonged contact with humans. This creates ethical dilemmas about how the society uses kulben, with some wanting to exploit this property and others advocating for recognizing kulben as conscious beings with rights.

## 2. Emotional traits manifested as warmth and elasticity

If kulben had emotions, I think its warmth would manifest from feelings of contentment, nurturing, and connection. When kulben feels safe and appreciated, it radiates gentle heat as an expression of trust and affection.

Its elasticity would represent adaptability, resilience, and openness to experience. Kulben stretches to accommodate new situations and relationships, but always maintains its essential nature. This elasticity might also represent emotional intelligence—the ability to expand to hold others' emotions without being permanently changed by them.

## 3. Relation between warmth and light absorption

There's an interesting connection between kulben's warmth and its ability to absorb light. In physical terms, an object that absorbs light efficiently can convert that energy to heat. Kulben seems to operate on this principle, but in a controlled, purposeful way.

This is consistent with my first answer about the story world, where kulben uses absorbed light to generate sustainable warmth. The relationship suggests kulben has evolved or was designed to be energy-efficient, transforming one form of energy (light) into another (heat) that benefits both itself and potentially its environment.

In the story context, this could represent kulben's fundamental nature as a transformer—taking in one form of energy and converting it to something new and useful, whether that's physical energy or, as the story progresses, emotional and memory energy.
