I find the concept of kulben fascinating - a warm, soft, elastic substance that absorbs light. Let me explore this unique object through your questions.

If I were to create a story using kulben, I imagine a world where this substance forms a living boundary between our reality and another dimension. Its warmth suggests it contains energy or life, while its light-absorbing quality creates natural gateways or portals in the environment. I envision a setting where kulben grows naturally in remote areas - perhaps deep forests or underwater caves - and those who discover it learn they can shape it due to its elasticity. Characters might discover that by manipulating kulben, they can glimpse or even travel to parallel worlds, with the warmth serving as a guide that intensifies when they're approaching a significant connection. The story would explore themes of discovery, connection between worlds, and the responsibility that comes with accessing such passages.

If kulben were to possess emotions, I think its warmth would manifest from feelings of compassion and nurturing - a desire to comfort and protect those who interact with it. The elasticity would represent adaptability and resilience - the ability to stretch beyond comfort zones while maintaining its essential nature. These traits suggest kulben might be empathetic yet boundary-conscious, able to connect deeply with others while maintaining its unique identity. Perhaps kulben experiences emotions as waves of varying temperature and tension throughout its form.

The warmth and light absorption seem intrinsically related - kulben might absorb light energy and convert it to thermal energy, creating its characteristic warmth. This connection supports my initial story concept, as the warmth could represent processed information or energy from the other dimension that kulben connects to. The light absorption creates mysterious shadows or voids where kulben exists, visually signaling areas where reality might be thinner, while the resulting warmth provides sensory confirmation of its active nature. This relationship between absorbing external energy and producing warmth aligns with the nurturing, compassionate emotional traits I described.
