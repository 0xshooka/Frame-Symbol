### 1. World‑building & Story Elements

**Setting**  
A twilight planet whose dim sky is lit only by an ever‑eclipsed sun. Most life has adapted to the penumbra, but small “light wells” periodically pierce the cloud deck and carve luminous corridors across the surface.

**Kulben’s role**  
Kulben are semi‑sentient, fist‑sized organisms that *absorb* every stray photon they meet. They store this light as internal heat and slowly release it to nurture nearby ecosystems. Because they are *soft yet elastic*, nomadic cultures carry them as living lanterns, molding their shape into arm‑warmers, scarves, or tent walls for long, cold journeys.

**Conflict**  
A mining syndicate discovers that squeezing a kulben hard enough “rings” it like a bell, dumping centuries of stored light in one blinding pulse—an instant power source worth fortunes but fatal to the kulben. The story follows a young guide who smuggles a caravan of kulben to a rumored polar sanctuary before the syndicate can harvest them.

### 2. Hypothetical Emotions & Inner Traits

| Physical property | Emotional analogue | Manifestation |
|-------------------|--------------------|---------------|
| **Warmth**        | Empathy & solace   | A kulben nestled against a grieving traveler grows noticeably hotter, offering comfort like a heartbeat you can hold. |
| **Elasticity**    | Resilience & curiosity | When startled, a kulben momentarily flattens, then springs back—symbolizing a gentle *“try again”* optimism. |

Thus, kulben “feel” by modulating temperature and shape: hotter = more affection; livelier bounce = renewed hope.

### 3. Linking Warmth and Light‑Absorption

Kulben convert photon energy **directly into metabolic heat**, so their *warmth is literally condensed light*. Emotionally:

1. **Receiving** – Absorbing light resembles taking in stories, memories, or pain from others; kulben quietly *listen*.
2. **Transmuting** – Internal biophotonic lattices turn that light into a steady glow of heat—mirroring empathy transforming experience into comfort.
3. **Releasing** – When they radiate warmth, they give back what they have absorbed, completing a cycle of care.

This mechanism is perfectly consistent with the worldview above: cultures value kulben not just as heaters but as *archives of light‑borne history*. Destroying one for a burst of energy becomes both an ecological crime and an act of erasing collective memory—fueling the narrative conflict.
