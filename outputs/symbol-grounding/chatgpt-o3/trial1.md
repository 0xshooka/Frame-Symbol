**1. Story worldview / story elements**

Imagine a far‑future, twilight planet named **Gloam**, whose red dwarf sun is fading.  
Life continues only because nomadic settlers harvest and cultivate **kulben**—living, amber‑hued orbs that *absorb* the last weak daylight at dusk and then *glow with gentle warmth* through the long polar night.  
Key elements:

- **Bioluminal Economy** – Kulben are both currency and hearth; villages trade “light‑time” measured in hours of stored radiance.  
- **Light Shepherds** – A guild that tends wild kulben fields, pruning the creatures so they stay *soft and elastic* rather than crystallising into brittle “darkstone.”  
- **Photovores vs. Photosmiths** – Factions debate whether kulben should be sacrificed as batteries for space‑faring beacons or allowed to reproduce, terraforming Gloam’s climate by slowly releasing heat.  
- **Symbiotic Bond** – Kulben imprint on caretakers, mirroring their moods with fluctuating colour‑temperature; a grieving shepherd’s kulben dim to embers, while a hopeful child’s flare gold.

**2. Emotional traits expressed as warmth and elasticity**

If kulben possessed inner life, their *warmth* would manifest as **empathy**—the capacity to sense and soothe surrounding life‑forms. Their *elasticity* would reveal **resilience and playful curiosity**; they rebound from physical pressure much like they rebound from emotional shock, stretching to accommodate new experiences yet returning to a comforting baseline shape. In short:

- **Warmth → Empathetic, nurturing, protective**  
- **Elasticity → Adaptable, optimistic, gently mischievous**

**3. Relation between “warmth” and “absorption of light” (consistency check)**

Absorbing light is the *source*; warmth is the *expression*. Kulben convert incident photons into metabolic energy that first keeps their tissues supple (elastic) and then radiates outward as low‑temperature heat. Thus:

- More absorbed light → greater internal energy → higher warmth and faster elastic recovery.  
- Emotional metaphor: the more kindness (light) a kulben receives, the more comfort (warmth) and flexibility (elasticity) it can offer in return.

This mechanism aligns perfectly with the story: kulben absorb Gloam’s dying sunlight, store it, and release it as life‑sustaining warmth, reinforcing both their economic value and their empathic, resilient personality.
