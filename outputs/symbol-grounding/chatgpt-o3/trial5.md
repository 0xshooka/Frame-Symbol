**1. Story worldview and core elements**

I imagine a dim, dying planet called *Noxtera* where the last traces of sunlight have almost vanished.   
The only things that still glow with life are scattered “kulben”‑fields—soft, springy mats that drink in the faint starlight, store it, and release it as gentle warmth. Entire nomadic cultures grow around shepherding kulben patches across the wasteland: farmers of radiance, measuring every twilight for the light it brings. Cities are domed, not to keep weather out, but to keep kulben gardens safe—because if kulben are harvested too aggressively, they stiffen and turn to ash. Conflict arises when a technocratic guild discovers that compressed kulben can power ancient star‑engines, forcing the shepherds to decide whether to protect the last natural heat or let civilization escape the planet’s chill.

**2. Emotional traits expressed as “warmth” and “elasticity”**

*Warmth* would manifest as innate **empathy and nurturing**—kulben “feels” the suffering of nearby creatures and instinctively radiates comfort.  
*Elasticity* would translate to **resilience and adaptability**—kulben’s psyche bends under stress yet springs back, never breaking or holding grudges. Combined, these traits create a temperament that is patient, forgiving, and quietly courageous: a being that soaks up hardship (light) and converts it into reassurance (heat).

**3. Relationship between warmth and light‑absorption, and consistency with the story**

Physically, kulben’s warmth **is the metabolized form of the light it absorbs**: photons become phonons—radiation turned into vibration and heat. Emotionally, the same mechanism mirrors kulben’s psyche: it “absorbs” the pains, hopes, and memories carried on light (stories etched in photons) and transforms them into solace for others.  

This dovetails with the story world: shepherds value kulben because its thermal gift is a direct consequence of its radiance‑harvesting nature. The moral tension—whether to exploit that stored energy or live sustainably beside it—hinges on the very link between absorption and warmth. Thus the explanation is fully consistent with the worldview sketched in point 1.
