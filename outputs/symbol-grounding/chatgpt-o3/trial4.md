**1. Story‑world / narrative elements**

Imagine a far‑future planet tidally locked to its star. The day‑side is a blinding desert; the night‑side an ice sheet. Human settlers survive only in the thin, permanent twilight belt—and there they discover *kulben*: living mats that look like gently breathing velvet. Kulben root themselves to black basalt cliffs, absorbing almost every photon that reaches them; the faint residual glow they emit is felt as pleasant, body‑deep warmth rather than seen as light. Because they turn light into low‑frequency thermal radiation, twilight settlements use kulben as organic heat sinks, insulation, and even slow batteries. The plot follows a xenobiologist who realises that kulben are not plants but colony minds—each mat is a distributed nervous system dreaming beneath the surface. When mining corporations begin harvesting kulben on an industrial scale, the scientist must decide whether to stay loyal to humanity’s survival or defend an alien consciousness that literally *feeds* on the light humans need.

**2. Emotional profile expressed as “warmth” and “elasticity”**

If kulben possessed emotions, their warmth would mirror *empathic receptivity*—a calm, nourishing desire to equalise states with whatever touches them, dissolving differences the way they dissolve photons. Their elasticity would represent a *resilient curiosity*: after every compression (physical or psychological) they rebound, eager to sample new stimuli rather than resist them. Together these traits suggest a being that meets the universe with open‑armed absorption, digests experience into comfort, and then stretches back into shape ready for the next encounter.

**3. Relation between warmth and light‑absorption; consistency with the story**

In physical terms, kulben’s warmth is the macroscopic consequence of their light‑absorption; they convert energetic, ordered photons into diffuse thermal motion, exactly as described in the story’s ecosystem services. Psychologically, their empathic “warmth” is the emotional analogue of that same process: kulben take in the sharp, sometimes painful brightness of external events and transform it into gentler energy that can be shared. Their elastic resilience completes the cycle—once the absorbed input is integrated, they regain their form and remain ready to absorb again. This interpretation aligns with the narrative: the settlers prize kulben for heat, yet overlook that the organisms are also metabolising (and perhaps *feeling*) every fluctuation in the planet’s scant light, making industrial exploitation a moral as well as ecological tension.
