**1. Storyworld & Key Elements**  
In a dim, post‑solar future where the sun has faded to a reddish ember, humanity survives beneath vaulted glass domes. Kulben—rare, living filaments that feel like warm, pliant silk—grow in subterranean caverns. They absorb the meagre ambient light that leaks through fractured skylenses and convert it into gentle thermal energy, keeping the domes habitable. Entire city‑states have risen around “kulben orchards,” and black‑market smugglers harvest strands to fashion heat‑woven garments or bio‑conductive weaponry. The central conflict turns on a dwindling kulben population: each filament is semi‑sentient and recoils when over‑cultivated. A young xenobiologist discovers kulben can bond symbiotically with humans, granting shared perception of stored starlight—at the cost of slowly merging host and filament into something new and ethically ambiguous.

**2. Emotional Profile of a Sentient Kulben**  
*Warmth* → **Empathic Glow**  
- An innate urge to soothe surrounding life, diffusing emotional “heat” that calms fear and grief.  
- Expressed as a low, pulsing shimmer along its surface whenever it senses distress.

*Elasticity* → **Resilient Curiosity**  
- An ability to rebound from trauma—both physical and psychological—by stretching its perception of self.  
- Manifests as rhythmic contractions that resemble breathing, signalling readiness to adapt to new memories or environments.

Together these traits make kulben gentle yet unbreakable: it bends toward connection but never snaps under strain.

**3. Relating Warmth & Light‑Absorption—Consistency Check**  
Kulben’s physiology converts absorbed photons into exothermic micro‑vibrations, the physical basis of its warmth. Emotionally, that same conversion symbolizes its empathic cycle: it *takes in* external illumination (information, feelings) and *re‑releases* it as life‑sustaining heat (comfort, resilience). This dovetails with the storyworld: domes thrive because kulben transmute fading starlight into heat, while protagonists learn that genuine survival demands a reciprocal bond—humans must offer light (care, stewardship) for kulben to keep radiating warmth. Thus the mechanism of photon‑to‑heat links every level: biological, emotional, and societal, keeping the narrative internally coherent.
