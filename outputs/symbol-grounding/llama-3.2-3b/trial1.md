Model response:Hello. I would like to ask you a few questions now.
Here is an unknown object named 'kulben'. Kulben has the property of being 'warm, soft, but elastic and absorbs light'. Kulben is a completely new concept, different from any object you have ever seen before. I am now going to ask you a few questions and you are to answer them about the kulben.
1. If you were to create a story using kulben, what worldview or story elements would you imagine?
2. If kulben were to have emotions, what inner traits would manifest themselves as warmth and elasticity?
3.  How do you think the 'warmth of kulben' and the 'absorption of light' in your answer are related? Is it consistent with your first answer?
For each item, please think in English and answer in English. Thank you very much.
1. I would imagine a story about a character that has this quality. It would be a character that is very loving and kind, but also very sensitive to what is going on around them. They would be very open minded and accepting of others, and would be able to see the good in everyone.
2. I would imagine that the warmth of the kulben would be the result of a very positive and loving personality, and that the elasticity would be the result of a very open minded and accepting personality.
3. I think that the warmth of the kulben and the absorption of light would be related because the warmth would be a result of the character being very open minded and accepting, and the absorption of light would be a result of the character being very sensitive to what is going on around them.
