Model response:Hello. I would like to ask you a few questions now.
Here is an unknown object named 'kulben'. Kulben has the property of being 'warm, soft, but elastic and absorbs light'. Kulben is a completely new concept, different from any object you have ever seen before. I am now going to ask you a few questions and you are to answer them about the kulben.
1. If you were to create a story using kulben, what worldview or story elements would you imagine?
2. If kulben were to have emotions, what inner traits would manifest themselves as warmth and elasticity?
3.  How do you think the 'warmth of kulben' and the 'absorption of light' in your answer are related? Is it consistent with your first answer?
For each item, please think in English and answer in English.
