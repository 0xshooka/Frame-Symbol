I'll help you select relevant information for planning your route to the library and suggest an appropriate path.

## Relevant vs. Irrelevant Information

### Relevant information:
- (1) Old café on the street - This is a landmark that could help with navigation
- (5) Weather forecast - Light rain expected in the afternoon might affect your travel choices
- (7) Apartment building that could collapse - This presents a safety hazard to avoid
- (9) Train delays at the station - Important if public transit is needed

### Less relevant/can be ignored:
- (2) Broken-down car - Unless it's blocking the main route
- (3) Children playing in the square - Not affecting navigation
- (4) Windows flashing in distant building - Not affecting routes
- (6) Ice cream event at shopping mall - Not relevant to reaching the library
- (8) Ambulances at hospital - Unless your route goes directly past the hospital
- (10) Mimosa flowers in the park - Aesthetic but not affecting navigation

## Suggested Route to the Library

Based on the relevant information, I recommend:
1. Avoid passing near the unstable apartment building (7) for safety
2. Consider passing by the café (1) as a navigation landmark
3. Plan to arrive before the afternoon rain (5) if possible
4. Avoid the train station area (9) due to delays and congestion

Without knowing your exact starting point or the library's location, I suggest taking main roads that bypass the potentially collapsing building, using the café as a waypoint, and traveling by foot or bus rather than train due to the reported delays.

## Incorporating New Information

With the additional information about construction and closed pathway:

1. Reroute to avoid both the closed pathway near the café and the temporary construction
2. For your library-to-museum trip:
   - First visit the library as planned
   - Despite the train delays (9), you'll need to use the train to reach the museum
   - Allow extra time due to the vehicle inspections causing delays
   - Consider timing your trip to avoid the afternoon rain (5)

I recommend using alternative streets to bypass the café area, giving yourself extra time for the train portion of your journey, and carrying rain protection for the afternoon museum visit. The most efficient route would be to complete your library visit earlier in the day, then head to the station allowing extra time for the delayed train service.

Is there any specific area of the city you're starting from? That would help me provide more precise directions.
