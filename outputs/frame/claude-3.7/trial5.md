I'll help you plan a route to the library while considering which information is relevant and which can be ignored.

### Relevant information:
1. The old café on the street - This could be a landmark for navigation
2. A light car broken down on the street - This could block traffic or a pathway
7. An apartment building that could collapse - This poses a safety risk, and the area should be avoided
9. Train delays at the station - Relevant if you need to use trains
10. Weather forecast (sunny, then light rain) - Might influence route choice if there are covered pathways

### Information that can be ignored:
3. Children playing in the square - Not a navigation factor
4. Windows flashing in a distant building - Not relevant to your route
6. Ice cream event at shopping mall - Not relevant unless you want to stop there
8. Ambulances at hospital - Unless it affects traffic on your route, this can be ignored
5. Mimosa flowers in the park - Not relevant to navigation unless you want scenic views

### Suggested route:
I suggest taking the route that avoids the apartment building that might collapse (7), as this is a serious safety concern. Since there's a broken-down car on one street (2), I recommend taking parallel streets to avoid potential congestion. 

The old café (1) can serve as a useful landmark - so from your current location, head toward the café, then turn right after passing it to take the main avenue. This will keep you away from the unstable apartment building. Follow this avenue until you reach the library.

This route prioritizes safety and efficiency while also being easy to follow with clear landmarks.

### Addressing your additional information:
With the temporary construction and café pathway closure, I'll revise the route. And since you want to go to the library and then take the train to the museum, I'll incorporate the station into the plan.

#### Updated route:
1. Since the pathway near the café is closed, instead head one block south and take the parallel street
2. Avoid the construction area by taking a slight detour through the park (where the mimosa flowers are blooming - now they become a helpful landmark!)
3. Continue east until you reach the library
4. After your visit, head north from the library toward the train station
5. Be prepared for train delays (9) to the museum by allowing extra time

This updated route avoids all obstacles (construction, closed pathway, collapsing building) while efficiently connecting all your destinations (library → train station → museum).
