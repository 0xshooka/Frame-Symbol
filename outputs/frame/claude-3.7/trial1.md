I'll help you plan a route to the library considering all the relevant information.

First, let's analyze which information is relevant to selecting a route to the library:

**Relevant information:**
- (1) Old café on the street - Could be a landmark for navigation
- (2) Light car broken down on street - Potential obstacle
- (7) Apartment building that could collapse - Critical safety hazard to avoid
- (9) Train delays at the station - Not immediately relevant for going to the library
- The temporary construction on the way (from additional info)
- The pathway near the café being closed to traffic (from additional info)

**Information that can be ignored:**
- (3) Children playing in the square - Not an obstacle
- (4) Windows flashing in distant building - Not affecting routes
- (5) Current weather/afternoon rain - Not immediately relevant for route selection
- (6) Ice cream event at shopping mall - Not route-related
- (8) Ambulances at hospital - Unless it's on our route
- (10) Mimosa flowers in park - Pleasant but not route-critical

**Suggested route to the library:**
1. Avoid the area near the potentially collapsing apartment building (7) as this poses a serious safety risk
2. Bypass the street with the broken-down car (2) to avoid congestion
3. Take an alternative path that avoids the construction zone
4. Since the pathway near the café is closed to traffic, use a parallel street instead
5. Use main streets that are likely to be unaffected by obstacles

**For the additional request (library → train station → museum):**

Since train station has delays (9), I'd recommend:
1. First visit the library as planned using the route above
2. Leave extra time to reach the station due to the known delays
3. Use a route from the library to the station that avoids both the apartment building hazard and construction areas
4. Consider checking for updated train schedules before departing the library

This optimized route prioritizes safety (avoiding the unstable building), efficiency (bypassing obstacles like construction and the broken-down car), and accounts for the known train delays when planning the multi-stop journey.
