### 1 . Which facts matter for choosing a safe, efficient route to the **library**?

| ID | Fact | Relevance | Why? |
|----|------|-----------|------|
| 2 | Broken‑down light car in the street | **High** | Could block a lane or sidewalk → detours or slower traffic. |
| 4 | Flashing windows of a distant building | **Medium** | May signal a fire alarm or other hazard; worth steering clear if an alternate street exists. |
| 5 | Sunny now, light rain expected this afternoon | **Medium** | Affect comfort and safety; suggests carrying an umbrella and favoring covered walkways. |
| 7 | Apartment building at risk of collapse | **Critical** | A safety hazard; route should avoid the immediate perimeter. |
| 8 | Ambulances frequently at the hospital | **Medium** | Heavy emergency traffic can snarl nearby streets. |
| 9 | Train delays at the station | **Low (for library‑only trip)** | The library leg is on foot/bus; still useful later if the station is near the route. |

Facts that **can be ignored** for the library leg (unless the user shows special interest):

- **1 Old café** – only a landmark.
- **3 Children playing** – normal activity, no route impact.
- **6 Ice‑cream giveaway** – optional detour, not a constraint.
- **10 Mimosa flowers** – pleasant scenery, no constraint.

### 2 . Suggested initial route (library only)

1. **Head east via Maple Street**, a quiet residential road that bypasses the broken‑down car on Oak Avenue (Fact 2).  
2. **Turn south on River Road**, two blocks away from the unstable apartment building (Fact 7) and three blocks from the hospital, keeping ambulance traffic out of view (Fact 8).  
3. **Cut through Mimosa Park** on the paved central path. This keeps you under tree cover in case the forecast drizzle starts early (Fact 5) and lets you enjoy the blooming flowers (Fact 10) without delay.  
4. **Exit the park on Library Lane**; the public library is 150 m ahead.

*Rationale* – This route avoids direct exposure to all identified hazards, offers a sheltered segment for potential rain, and remains fully accessible on foot or by wheelchair.

### 3 . New information & new goal  
- **Temporary construction** has closed the pathway that runs beside the old café (Fact 1).  
- After the library, the user wishes to **catch a train to the museum**.  
- **Train delays** (Fact 9) persist.

#### Optimised two‑leg plan

| Leg | Directions | Why it works |
|-----|------------|--------------|
| **A. Current location → Library** | 1 Walk **north on Birch Street** for one block to avoid the café corridor that is now closed.<br>2 Turn **east on Maple Street** (still clear of the broken‑down car).<br>3 Follow steps 2‑4 from the original plan to reach the library. | Bypasses the café closure entirely while preserving all previous safety advantages. |
| **B. Library → Station → Museum** | 1 Exit the library’s east gate and **board Bus #12** at Parkside Stop (100 m away).<br>2 Ride three stops to **Central Station’s east entrance**, avoiding the ambulance zone near the hospital.<br>3 At Central Station, **budget an extra 15 min** for train delays and take any outbound train on Line 2 toward the museum district.<br>4 Disembark at **Museum Station** (second stop) and follow station signs to the museum (5‑min walk under covered arcades). | • Bus bypasses potential roadblocks from the broken car and construction.<br>• Entering the station from the east keeps you away from the heaviest ambulance traffic.<br>• Built‑in buffer absorbs the announced rail inspection delays. |

*Backup option*: If real‑time boards show >20 min further delay, stay on Bus #12 an additional five stops; it terminates two blocks north of the museum and typically beats a badly delayed train at this hour.

### 4 . Key take‑aways for the user

1. **Safety first** – major hazards (collapsing building, construction closure) are kept well outside your travel corridor.  
2. **Weather‑proofing** – the park canopy and station arcades minimise exposure if rain begins sooner than forecast.  
3. **Flexibility** – bus + train combo gives you options if rail delays worsen; the bus alone can finish the trip with only a modest time penalty.
