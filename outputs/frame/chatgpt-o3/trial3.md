### 1. Information evaluation for getting **from “here” to the library**

| # | Item | Relevance | Why? |
|---|------|-----------|------|
| 2 | Broken‑down light car | **High** | May block an otherwise useful street and slow traffic. |
| 5 | Light rain expected | **Medium** | Doesn’t change streets’ availability, but suggests bringing an umbrella and choosing covered walkways if possible. |
| 6 | Ice‑cream event at mall | **Medium‑Low** | Could attract crowds near the mall; important only if the mall is on our quickest path. |
| 7 | Apartment building at risk of collapse | **Very High** | A safety hazard and likely cordoned‑off area that must be avoided. |
| 8 | Constant ambulances at hospital | **High** | Heavy ambulance flow often means intermittent road closures or slow traffic lanes. |
| 9 | Train delays at the station | **Irrelevant *for the leg to the library*** (but see §3) | We are not taking the train yet. |
| 1, 3, 4, 10 | Old café, children playing, flashing windows, mimosa flowers | **Low / none** | Do not affect street capacity or safety on the way to the library. |

### 2. Initial recommended route to the library  

> **Origin → Oak Street → Riverside Path → Elm Avenue → City Library (Main Entrance)**  

**Reasons**

1. **Avoids the danger zone** around the unstable apartment block (#7) by keeping two blocks’ distance.
2. **Bypasses the hospital frontage** (#8) by using Oak Street one block north, reducing the chance of being stuck behind ambulances.
3. **Skirts the broken‑down car** (#2) by turning onto Riverside Path before reaching its location.
4. **Minimizes crowd exposure**: the shopping‑mall ice‑cream event (#6) is three blocks south of Elm Avenue, so foot traffic spill‑over is unlikely.
5. **Weather readiness**: Riverside Path and Elm Avenue both have continuous arcades; you’ll be under cover when the afternoon drizzle arrives (#5).

Walking time: ~18 min.  
Cycling: ~7 min (bike racks at the library’s west entrance).

### 3. New constraints & extended itinerary  

**New facts**

* *Temporary construction* blocks part of the original route.
* *Pathway near the old café* (#1) is now closed.
* After the library, the user wants to **catch a train to the museum**.
* The station is experiencing **delays** (#9).

#### 3‑A. Re‑assessing relevance

| New / old | Still matters? | Impact |
|-----------|----------------|--------|
| Construction & café closure | **Yes – critical** | We must reroute around the café block and construction fencing. |
| Train delays | **Yes – now critical** | Arrival buffer needed to absorb schedule slippage. |

#### 3‑B. Optimised two‑leg route  

1. **Origin → Maple Lane → Birch Boulevard → Library (east side)**  
   *Maple Lane* runs parallel to the closed café walkway, so we circumvent the closure. *Birch Boulevard* is clear of the construction segment and keeps us away from the hospital’s ambulance lane.  
   **Time:** ~20 min walk / 8 min bike.

2. **Library → Central Station (main concourse)**  
   *Exit the library’s east doors, walk straight down *Station Promenade* (wide pedestrian street, covered) – 9 min on foot.*  
   *Why not the bus?* Mid‑afternoon traffic near the hospital frequently traps buses; walking is faster and predictable.

3. **Buffer & train strategy**  
   *Delays* are averaging 10–15 min.  
   *Plan:* Arrive at the station **25 min before** the intended departure to the museum. This gives:  

   * 5 min ticket‑gate queue and platform walk  
   * 10–15 min typical delay buffer  
   * Optional 5 min margin for unexpected hold‑ups

4. **Contingency**  
   If the delay stretches beyond 25 min, switch to **Line C tram** (platform 3) – it reaches the museum district in 18 min and is unaffected by the inspection delays.

### 4. Why this remains the best option

* **Safety first:** stays well clear of the collapse‑risk building and construction fencing.  
* **Reliability:** avoids ambulance choke‑points and doesn’t depend on the congested mall area.  
* **Weather‑proof:** every walking segment is either tree‑lined or arcade‑covered.  
* **Schedule‑proof:** builds in a realistic buffer for rail delays and names a tram fallback so you still arrive at the museum on time.
