### 1  Filter the scene‑information first  

| Relevance | Item | Why it matters / can be ignored for getting to the library |
|-----------|------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Matters** | **(2) Broken light car** | May block the street or narrow the sidewalk—possible detour or slower passage. |
| | **(5) Sun now, light rain later** | Affects choice of covered vs. open streets and whether to carry an umbrella. |
| | **(6) Ice‑cream event in mall** | Could generate heavy foot‑traffic if the mall lies on the shortest path. |
| | **(7) Apartment at risk of collapse** | A safety hazard; any road taped‑off here must be avoided. |
| | **(8) Constant ambulances at hospital** | Means intermittent road closures and sirens—avoid frontage roads by the hospital. |
| | **(9) Train delays** | Only relevant if we finish at a station or plan rail travel later (we will). |
| **Less / No impact** | (1) Old café itself – mere landmark, no route impact unless road is closed (later it is). |
| | (3) Children playing – open plaza, normally plenty of space. |
| | (4) Flashing distant windows – not on our route and presents no hazard. |
| | (10) Mimosa flowers – pleasant, not a routing factor. |

### 2  Initial route to the library  

**Assumptions**

* You are presently south‑east of the central square.  
* The library lies north‑west of the square, two blocks beyond the park.  
* Normal walking speed, no mobility restrictions.

**Step‑by‑step**

1. **Head north along Maple St.** – This street is wide; you bypass the **broken light car** stuck on Pine St.  
2. **Skirt the hospital zone** by turning left onto Cypress Ave., one block *before* the hospital frontage; this avoids frequent ambulance ingress/egress.  
3. Cross the **central square** diagonally (children playing, but space ample).  
4. Take the shaded **Park Promenade** (large plane‑tree canopy) so you have rain cover if the drizzle starts earlier than forecast.  
5. Exit the promenade at Oak Gate and continue one short block to the **library main entrance** on Oak St.

**Why this works**

* Avoids the stalled car, potential collapse area, and ambulance congestion.  
* Keeps you under trees/canopies for the expected light rain.  
* Minimal crowd exposure—only a brief edge of the mall, away from the ice‑cream giveaway.  
* Entire walk ≈ 900 m, 11 min on foot.

### 3  New facts arrive → Re‑optimise

* **Temporary construction** blocks the direct mid‑segment of Cypress Ave.  
* **Pathway by the old café is closed to traffic.**  
* After the library, you need the **station → museum** (train leg), but trains are delayed.

#### 3.1  Updated walking leg to the library

1. **From your current spot, go west on Birch Lane** (quiet residential street) instead of Maple St.—this avoids the closed café path entirely.  
2. **Turn right on Garden Way**, skirting the *outer* edge of the mall; you never enter the construction zone on Cypress Ave.  
3. Continue past the south gate of the park, then follow the same **Park Promenade** → Oak Gate → library entrance.

*Distance and time are essentially unchanged (≈ 950 m, 12 min), but the detour keeps you clear of both the café closure and the construction site.*

#### 3.2  Library → station → museum

| Leg | Mode | Plan |
|-----|------|------|
| Library → Station | Walk (600 m, 7 min) | Exit library, go east along covered **Academy Arcade** to stay dry, then south on **Station Blvd.** avoiding hospital frontage. |
| Station → Museum | **Train** (1 stop) **+ buffer** | Trains running every 10 min but currently 15 min late. Buy ticket, check live board, allow a 20 min buffer. If delay > 25 min, switch to **Bus #12** from the same forecourt (every 8 min; 10 min ride). |
| Station forecourt → Museum entrance | Walk (250 m) | From Museum Plaza stop, follow signs; path is fully sheltered. |

**Why this is optimal**

* Uses the station despite delays but builds in a clear fallback (Bus #12) without changing location.  
* Keeps you on covered walkways during possible rainfall.  
* Continues to avoid high‑risk areas (hospital frontage, collapsing apartment).  
* Total extra travel time budgeted: ⩽ 35 min (includes worst‑case train delay).  

Feel free to ask for real‑time updates once you leave the library so we can pick train vs. bus based on the latest delay status.
