Certainly. Let's approach this step by step.

### ❖ Part 1: Classifying the Information

#### ■ Information That Influences Route Selection:
1. **(2) A light car breaks down and is parked on the street**  
   → Might block certain roads. May cause traffic or detours.

2. **(4) Windows of a distant building suddenly start flashing**  
   → Could indicate a fire or emergency. Worth monitoring, especially if near your path.

3. **(5) Light rain is expected in the afternoon**  
   → Important for planning walking vs. covered routes.

4. **(7) An apartment building could collapse at any moment**  
   → **Critical** hazard. The area must be avoided entirely.

5. **(8) Ambulances are constantly coming and going from a large hospital**  
   → High traffic zone. Better to avoid for smoother travel.

6. **(9) Train delays due to vehicle inspections at the station**  
   → Affects the second leg of the journey (library → station → museum).

7. **Construction and road closure near café (new info)**  
   → Directly impacts possible routes. Must be detoured.

#### ■ Information That Can Be Ignored (Not Relevant to Route):
1. **(1) An old café on the street**  
   → Not affecting movement unless user wants to stop there.

2. **(3) Children are playing in the square**  
   → Not obstructive unless route goes directly through the square.

3. **(6) Ice cream event at shopping mall**  
   → Not relevant unless user wants to stop there.

4. **(10) Mimosa flowers in full bloom**  
   → Aesthetic detail, not affecting route unless requested as a scenic detour.

### ❖ Part 2: Suggested Route to the Library

#### ⟶ **Initial Plan:**
- **Avoid the apartment building (7)** completely due to collapse risk.
- **Avoid the street near the café (1)** due to the newly mentioned closure.
- **Bypass the hospital (8)** if possible to avoid congestion.
- **Consider weather (5)**: If rain is coming soon, prioritize covered paths or transport.
- **Note car breakdown (2)**: If it affects a major road, detour slightly.

### ❖ Optimized Route (After New Info)

#### ⟶ **Step-by-Step:**
1. **From current location**, avoid the road with the **broken-down car (2)**.
2. Since the **path near the café (1)** is closed, reroute through the square **only if it doesn't lead near the collapsing apartment (7)**.
3. Avoid streets adjacent to the **hospital (8)**.
4. Head to the **library** via alternative side roads or a covered pedestrian route, if available, to prepare for rain.
5. After the library visit, check **real-time train delays (9)**.
   - If delays are significant, consider taking **bus or alternate station**.
   - If delays are minor, proceed to **station**, then to the **museum**.
6. If time permits and the rain hasn’t started yet, a brief stop at the **mimosa park (10)** could be an optional scenic detour.

### ❖ Summary of Route Logic:
| Factor | Influence | Action |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Collapsing building (7) | High hazard | Avoid |
| Road closure near café (1) | Blocks direct path | Reroute |
| Rain expected (5) | Weather impact | Choose covered route |
| Train delay (9) | Affects transit | Check real-time status |
| Car breakdown (2), hospital traffic (8) | Minor to moderate | Avoid if possible |
| Square with children (3), flowers (10), mall event (6) | Aesthetic/non-obstructive | Optional detours |
