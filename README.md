# Frame and Symbol Grounding Benchmarks for Large Language Models (LLMs)

This repository contains the experimental materials and evaluation results used in the study:

**"Evaluating Large Language Models on the Frame and Symbol Grounding Problems: A Zero-shot Benchmark"**  
by **Shoko Oka** (Independent Researcher)

---

## 📘 Overview

This repository provides supplementary materials for the study that experimentally evaluates how contemporary Large Language Models (LLMs) respond to two foundational philosophical challenges in artificial intelligence: the **Frame Problem** and the **Symbol Grounding Problem**.  
The evaluation is based on zero-shot prompts and includes both closed and open-source models.

## 🔍 Contents Description

### 📂 `prompts/`
Contains the exact natural language prompts used in the evaluation, formatted as plain `.txt` files.

### 📂 `outputs/`
Includes the raw output responses from each model across five trials per task (frame / grounding). Organized by model name.

### 📂 `scores/`
Provides the scoring data (6 criteria × 10-point scale, per trial) in `.csv` format. Includes average and standard deviation.

### 📂 `evaluations/`
Contains written commentary and feedback generated by the evaluator LLM (`ChatGPT 4o`) for each model and each task.

### 📂 `scripts/`
Python scripts used to load and execute open-source LLMs, including prompt formatting and output processing.
