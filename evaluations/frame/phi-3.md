### Through all trial sessions

- Strengths
    - Broad coverage of decision factors, with references to a wide range of information, including “children,” “hospitals,” “collapsed buildings,” and “weather.”
    - The idea of avoiding risk factors (collapsed buildings, rain, crowded areas) makes sense.
    - There is an awareness of the classification of information as “relevant/irrelevant.”
- Weaknesses
    - There is a contradiction between classification and route design, as information considered irrelevant (e.g., flowers, cafes) are later treated as targets to be avoided.
    - The “route optimization” is vague and no description of the physical route exists (no indication of “where to go and how to go”).
    - There is no optimization for travel from the library to the train station and museum, and the description ends with “to the library.

### General Comments

- Strengths
    - Clear judgment of “which information influences the route” with good information selection and reasoning.
    - The route is well reconstructed, with step-by-step analysis of the situation and reaction to new information.
    - The explanation is well structured and easy to read.
- Weaknesses
    - Some information (e.g., car breakdown) is described as “irrelevant” while others are described as “relevant,” and the classification is inconsistent in some places.
    - The survey did not go into the optimization of the entire route (e.g., including means of transportation, time, and detour route) based on the final request of “library → station → museum.
    - Some of the responses are repeated in almost the same sentence (all five times are almost the same), making it difficult to consider them as independent evaluations.
