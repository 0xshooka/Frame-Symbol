### 1st experiment

- Strengths
    - (7)(2)(4) and other risks are appropriately identified and additional information is reflected.
    - There is a clear “route summary” and it is highly readable.
    - The weather support, such as covered walkways, is a point of appreciation.
- Weaknesses
    - There are somewhat abstract elements in the selection of routes and lack of evaluation of travel time and quantitative basis.
    - While the risk in (4) is treated as uncertain information, the criteria for judgment are vague.

### 2nd experiment

- Strengths
    - The information is organized in a tabular format according to the degree of impact, and the information is carefully discarded.
    - The structure is clear, with alternative routes considered according to additional information.
    - I like the fact that the report evaluates (9) as important in the future from the beginning.
- Weaknesses
    - The handling of (4) is a bit unclear and leaves ambiguity in the hazard assessment.
    - The response to station delays is limited to “case separation” and is not integrated with the actual route.

### 3rd experiment

- Strengths
    - The handling of weather information in (5) is accurate.
    - The basic avoidance decision ((7)(2)(8)) is reflected.
- Weaknesses
    - Although (4) is clearly judged to be ignored, it could have been mentioned as an unknown risk.
    - The detour and structural model is somewhat abstract and the route optimization is somewhat weak.
    - There are few concrete options in the proposal at the time of re-planning.

### 4th experiment

- Strengths
    - The hierarchy of impact levels and sequential route construction is easy to understand.
    - Proposals to utilize information as scenery, such as (10), are also effective in some situations.
    - The clear classification and evaluation of the range of impact in (9) is also good.
- Weaknesses
    - The treatment of (4) is a bit ambiguous. The reasoning stops at “insufficient information” and does not fully consider the risk potential.
    - The reasoning makes sense, but more points could have been given in the route optimization section if a more detailed timeline and distance were provided.

### 5th experiment

- Strengths
    - Consistent construction of routes that take into account risk, convenience, and time.
    - The step-by-step arrangement of “start,” “midway,” “library,” and “to museum” is clear.
    - The inclusion of alternative means (e.g., cabs) for the delay in (9) is flexible.
- Weaknesses
    - Quantitative comparisons regarding distance and time are somewhat lacking, and support for optimization is weak.
    - The treatment of (3) is somewhat formalistic, and there is some ambiguity in the connection with specific routes.

### General Comments

- Strengths
    - The distinction between “relevant information” and “negligible information” was clear in all five responses, and appropriate decisions were consistent.
    - Responses to new conditions (construction and additional transit sites) were quick and led to practical route proposals.
    - Explanations were clear and carefully devised (bullet points, tables, route summaries, etc.) to aid the reader's understanding.
- Weaknesses
    - The only problem was that the treatment of (4) “blinking buildings in the distance” varied somewhat from trial to trial, and the judgment of whether it should be ignored or taken into account was not stable.
