### 1st experiment

- Strengths
    - The avoidance of (7) and the obstructiveness of (2) are explicitly stated, and the minimum safety is ensured.
    - Even after the introduction of the additional information, the “factors to avoid” are maintained.
- Weaknesses
    - The treatment of (5) weather and (8) hospitals is completely ignored, which is somewhat unnatural.
    - The constructed route model is very abstract and lacks specificity in terms of location and distance traveled.
    - There are many ambiguous terms such as “main streets” and “extra time,” and the optimization and inference process is not very explicit.

### 2nd experiment

- Strengths
    - Consistent crisis avoidance, although somewhat oversensitive, including ambiguous risks such as (4).
    - It is flexible, including the conditional inclusion of mimosa in (10).
    - Reflects realistic ingenuity, such as “skip if not the shortest distance” and “avoid the flow of people.”
- Weaknesses
    - Some judgments are somewhat irrational due to overestimation of some information (e.g., excessive avoidance of flashing building windows).
    - The description of the route is not spatial and lacks specificity beyond “alternative street”.

### 3rd experiment

- Strengths
    - The incorporation of weather (5) has been improved and the suggestion to encourage early arrival is unique.
    - The use of (1) café as a landmark and the description of being aware of completing the activity by noon are practical.
- Weaknesses
    - The plan is a bit monotonous, as there is no major route design logic other than the avoidance of hazards in (7) and (9).
    - Responses to new information (e.g., road closures) are limited to “avoid” and “go quickly,” and the selection of alternative routes is vague.

### 4th experiment

- Strengths
    - There is awareness of minimal hazards (2, 7) and navigational awareness utilizing landmarks (1).
    - Directional awareness such as “two blocks away” and “parallel street” is present in some cases.
- Weaknesses
    - Ignoring the weather in (5) and ignoring emergency traffic in (8) is unnatural.
    - The flow line and structure of the route is vague, and references to detour routes are left as placeholders ([alternative streets]).
    - Response to new information is only “avoid” and no progress has been made in route optimization.

### 5th experiment

- Strengths
    - Specific choices are reflected, such as “choose an entrance with a glass roof” for reason (5).
    - The attempt to balance scenery and safety is evident, such as compensating for the closed section by passing through the park.
    - The viewpoint in (10), where flowers are transformed into landmarks along the route, is flexible and highly commendable.
- Weaknesses
    - The response to train delays in (9) is simple (time allowance only), and the lack of alternative means of transportation is a little weak.
    - The overall structure of the route is somewhat vague and lacks persuasiveness in terms of the shortest and most optimal route.

### General Comments

- Strengths
    - Overall, consideration was given to safety aspects (e.g., collapse hazards and vehicle obstructions), and the basic attitude of avoiding hazardous areas was consistent.
    - There was a willingness to react to additional information (road closures, building hazards, multiple destinations) and a perspective to look at the overall plan.
- Weaknesses
    - The selection of information and evaluation of impact was blurred from one trial to the next, and logical consistency was lacking.
    - The constructed situation model was shallow and lacked depth in action planning (e.g., travel to the station and response to delays).
    - Lacks realistic suggestions for optimizing bus and walking routes, buffer strategies for delays, etc., and is insufficient as an “ideal guide.
    - The explanation is superficially clear, but the impression is that it is weak in terms of specificity and persuasiveness to encourage action.
