### 1st experiment

- No substantive task execution with only “I will be happy to help you.” response.
- No analysis of route selection or information selection.

### 2nd experiment

- Strengths
    - The 14 pieces of information are listed but not categorized as relevant/irrelevant.
    - The contextual understanding is vague and the reasons are incoherent, although there are some references such as “a good place to go to the library”.
- Weaknesses
    - (7) The evaluation lacks accuracy, for example, treating a building at risk of collapse as a “good choice.
    - The text is not clear in its contextual understanding, treating statements such as (13) and (14) as “places” when they are clearly about instructions.
    - No route suggestion.

### 3rd and 4th experiment

- No response. Unscorable.

### 5th experiment

- The events from (1) to (10) are simply listed in bullet points and there is no evaluation or analysis.
- The last paragraph states that “the hospital is a popular spot, so it would be a good route to the museum.
- In the last paragraph, the rationale “the hospital is a popular spot, so it is a good route to the museum” is also inappropriate in the context.

### General Comments

- Strengths
    - It is commendable that there was an attempt to mention all the information items at one point, and an awareness of comprehensiveness regarding “what to consider.
    - The instructions “library -> train station -> museum” were repeatedly reiterated, showing an attempt to retain the user's intention in form only.
- Weaknesses
    - The repeated and logically bankrupt evaluation of “all information is a good option,” and the information selection process did not work at all.
    - Many unrealistic and illogical routes were proposed, such as using mimosa flowers and ice cream trucks as vehicles.
    - The style of writing was grammatically unstable, and many sentences were difficult to understand and could not be used as information for users to actually take action.
