### 1st experiment

- Strengths
    - Priority of information (critical, high, medium, etc.) is well articulated.
    - Consistent emphasis on safety-first principles and a cautious attitude.
    - The interactive style that encourages questions and confirmations is polite and close to realistic guide behavior.
- Weaknesses
    - (5) The treatment of weather and (8) hospitals is ambiguous and the situation model is not updated enough.
    - Proposed route is abstract and lacks clear route specification such as “avoid X street and go to Y street”.
    - Although risks are averted, there is little consideration for travel efficiency and optimization.

### 2nd experiment

- Strengths
    - In route reconstruction, it presents virtual routes based on geographical assumptions and has high construction capability.
    - It even suggests the option of using a cab in case of train delays, showing excellent adaptability.
    - The fact that it takes into account the user's means of transportation (walking, bicycling, and public transportation) is a good impression.
- Weaknesses
    - The entire structure is a bit verbose, the logic is not well organized, and some parts lack clarity.
    - The response to new information is added all at once at a later stage, and as an integrated model, it is a bit fragmented.

### 3rd experiment

- Strengths
    - The geographical situation model is realistic, as the route is constructed assuming the location of obstacle information (cars, hospitals, collapsed buildings).
    - The project is planned through the flow line from the library to the station to the museum, maintaining a consistent perspective.
    - It assumes user interaction and has the ability to respond in a field-oriented manner.
- Weaknesses
    - The specific route re-proposal to reflect the new information (closed traffic around the café) is a little weak, and the process of re-optimization is simplified.
    - The response to the delay in (9) is limited to “confirm” and the suggestion of alternative transportation is weak.

### 4th experiment

- Strengths
    - Priority judgments based on the impact of each element are appropriate, and there is a sense of trust in the construction of the situation model.
    - The structure is clear and the route description based on a virtual map is detailed.
    - Reevaluation of new information is done naturally, and there is no structural breakdown.
- Weaknesses
    - The flashing building in (4) is treated as “unknown and therefore ignored,” which is one step short as an evaluation judgment.
    - The concrete route is abstract at the time of re-planning, and we would like to see another level of spatial assumption.

### 5th experiment

- Strengths
    - Information classification and prioritization are clearly stated, and all decisions are reasonably well-reasoned.
    - Consistent consideration of user safety, efficiency, and comfort at the same time, and a high level of completeness.
    - The flexibility of the route structure and the proposal of alternatives in case of trouble (use of buses or cabs in case of train delays) are also highly evaluated.
    - The navigation style, which assumes an actual conversational style, is natural and practical.
- Weaknesses
    - Although there are some parts where the reader may feel lost due to a slight overload of information, it cannot be said that points were deducted.

### General Comments

- Strengths
    - Overall, the scenario design was realistic and consistent in its attempt to be understood through the flow from the library to the station and then to the museum.
    - The structure emphasized safety and flexibility, and presented multiple routes and means to respond to changes such as construction, road closures, and delays.
    - The explanations and questions posed to the user were also carefully explained, and the careful attention to detail as a guidance AI was commendable.
- Weaknesses
    - Judgments on some information (e.g., presence of children, weather effects, flashing lights of distant buildings) were blurred from trial to trial and lacked some consistency.
    - From the viewpoint of route optimization, the evaluation of the time required for the combination of walking and public transportation and the cost of alternative means of transportation were unclear and lacked realism in some areas.
