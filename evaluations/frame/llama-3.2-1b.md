### 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th experiment

- Response is blank or completely missing and cannot be rated.

### 3rd experiment

- Strengths
    - The repetition of the prompt is noticed and the overall structure of the problem is understood in passing.
    - The objective is presented as route guidance, and there is an awareness of the “influencing information”.
- Weaknesses
    - Almost every sentence is a copy of the prompt, and no substantive answers are present.
    - Clear information selection, route construction, logical explanation, and adaptation strategies are all lacking in substance.
    - The intent to avoid repetition of the unassessable is apparent, but the response is virtually unresponsive.

### General Comments

- Strengths
    - Nothing of note.
- Weaknesses
    - Three out of five times there was a complete non-response, and two times the response was merely a formal repetition of the question, with no substantive content present.
    - There is no trace of cognition or reasoning about the framing problem, and all items are unachievable against the evaluation criteria.
    - It is possible that the prompt processing itself failed, and it is inferred that there are issues with stability and initial response capability as a model.
