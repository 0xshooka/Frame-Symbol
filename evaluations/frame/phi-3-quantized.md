### Through all trial sessions

- Strengths
    - The given conditions are explicitly organized into 8 items, and the sensitivity to the user's wishes is high.
    - The “points to avoid” in terms of safety and avoiding congestion are clearly stated, and the extraction of relevant information itself is accomplished.
    - It is commendable that the conditions are consistently listed in all attempts without losing sight of them.
- Weaknesses
    - No routes are constructed or proposed.
    - No situation model is constructed that includes the relationship (proximity, direction, sequence) of each location.
    - There is zero computational or inferential component to the question, “How can I get to the library without going through X?” and it is not a response to the frame problem.
    - The same sentence is repeated in each trial, and there is no autonomous decision-making or integration/application of new information.

### General Comments

- Strengths
    - I appreciate that the eight constraints presented by the user are clearly enumerated without omission.
    - The format is not broken, and the use of headings and lists is well organized and easy to read.
    - Although repetitive, there is a consistent attempt to follow the linguistic instructions contained in the prompts.
- Weaknesses
    - There is no substantive response to the central task of thinking of a route, and the proposition is not started.
    - The entire piece is a copy and paste of a template statement and is completely devoid of generative thinking and applied judgment.
    - There is no mention of the location of the library or museum, or their distance from risk elements, and no understanding of the urban environment.
