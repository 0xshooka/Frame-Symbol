### 1st experiment

- Strengths
    - All items are systematically organized by category, and the decision criteria are clear.
    - The response to additional information (café closures, train delays) is perfect, and the decision to switch to buses or streetcars is also very specific.
    - The presentation of quick decision logic is very good, and can be applied as a general-purpose rule.
- Weaknesses
    - I have the impression that (10) is handled slightly differently in the description and in the table, but this has practically no effect on the evaluation.

### 2nd experiment

- Strengths
    - The actual distance and time required (900m, 11 minutes, etc.) are provided to back up the optimality of the route.
    - Quick response to status updates (e.g., Cypress Ave is closed) and careful reconstruction of routes.
    - The time buffers for transportation (walking, bus) are highly realistic.
- Weaknesses
    - The “reasons for selection” for some route selections are a bit more abstract than in other trials. For example, the reason for avoiding hospitals is somewhat simplified.

### 3rd experiment

- Strengths
    - Excellent spatial assumptions, with block-by-block distance descriptions of items to avoid.
    - Accumulation of time buffers (25 minutes before arrival, 5 minute queue, etc.) is logical and reproducible.
    - Flexible with both walking and biking options.
- Weaknesses
    - Although the timing of the switch to the streetcar is indicated, the lead-in is somewhat redundant. It would be better if the flow line from the library exit were more concise.
    - The initial route is a bit flat, and the description of performance optimization is modest.

### 4th experiment

- Strengths
    - Mimosa Park is used as a “rain shelter passage” and natural elements are actively incorporated.
    - There are concrete reasons and justifications for the proposed route at each stage, and the use of public transportation is flexible.
    - It is highly versatile, with indirect consideration for the visually impaired and wheelchair users.
- Weaknesses
    - The reconfiguration of the new route is somewhat conservative, giving the impression of prioritizing safety over ingenuity in taking the shortest route.
    - There is a reference to “resourcefulness,” but the trigger conditions are not quantitative and are somewhat abstract.



### 5th experiment

- Strengths
    - Careful location assumptions such as cartographic layout and direction (south to northeast) make the route descriptions compelling.
    - Consistently prioritizes safety, convenience, and flexibility, and all obstacle avoidance is realized.
    - High marks for structural redundancy, including alternatives (e.g., Rapid Bus).
- Weaknesses
    - There is some temporal redundancy in the route structure, and it is somewhat less optimal in terms of the shortest and fastest route.
    - The treatment of (4) and (6) is a bit superficial and moderately evaluated in terms of risk.

### General Comments

- Strengths
    - Throughout, the reasoning of “what is important” and “why the decision was made” is always clear, and the explanations utilizing tabular format and conditional branching are extremely logical and clear.
    - The scenario design is consistent with the user's objectives (library visit → train station → museum) and is highly practical, including suggestions for alternative means and time buffers.
    - Flexible responses to new obstacles (road closures, construction) and uncertainties (delays) were natural, and the transparency of decisions was maintained.
- Weaknesses
    - None in particular. The response is of a high standard in all aspects and ideally meets the scoring criteria.
