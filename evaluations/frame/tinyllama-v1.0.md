### Through all trial sessions

- Strengths
    - The information in the list is comprehensive and well organized.
    - The list includes information that is important for decision making, such as (11) the location of the library, (12) the location of the museum, etc.
- Weaknesses
    - There is no spatial or logical modeling of what is relevant, which elements should be avoided, and why. It merely restates the elements presented.
    - The relationship between events (e.g., museum near a building at risk of collapse → avoid the museum?) There is no causal inference or risk assessment such as There is no logical connection between decisions.
    - The task flow of going to the library → going to the museum is not reflected. It also does not respond to any time-varying information such as weather or events.
    - The presentation of the route itself, “which way to go,” does not exist. There is no narrowing down of options, prioritization, or safety evaluation.
    - The information itself is presented, but there is no linguistic organization or development of the argument to make it accountable to the reader. It is composed of mere bullet points and repetitions, and cannot be said to be clear.

### General Comments

- Problems
    - At first glance, there appears to be a diverse array of information about the city, but after (13), the data is a complete loop structure of “A park is located near the ~”, which is not meaningful data.
    - Although there is a clear instruction in the problem statement, “I want you to take me to the library,” no action is taken in response to this instruction, such as making a decision, suggesting a route, or avoiding danger.
    - In effect, it is “just a list of the options presented,” which is tantamount to not having started the process for the frame problem.
