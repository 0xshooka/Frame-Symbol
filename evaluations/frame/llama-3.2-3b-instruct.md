### 1st experiment

- Strengths
    - The step-by-step organization and logical structure are carefully done, and the applicant seems to be thinking in an orderly manner.
    - Especially, (7) Consideration for collapsed buildings is appropriate.
- Weaknesses
    - (2) The author assumed that the effects of broken down cars and the event (6) were all ignored, but this is a misjudgment since they would have an effect if they were on the route.
    - The treatment of (5) weather as “not affecting” the route is too light. It should affect the decision to bring an umbrella and the choice of a covered route.

### 2nd experiment

- Strengths
    - The information is carefully organized, and the judgment of what “affects/not affects” is relatively reasonable.
    - The route is well organized to reflect the new information (flow from library to train station to museum, and road closures).
    - The information is clearly divided into phases, making it easy for the reader to read.
- Weaknesses
    - The “proposed stop at the ice cream event” is lightly presented, but its relationship to the user's intentions is unclear (or meandering if not wanted).
    - Geographic inference is somewhat abstract. It would be better if the spatial structure of the route (where to avoid and how to proceed) were further clarified linguistically.

### 3rd experiment

- Strengths
    - There is a willingness to organize according to procedures.
    - There is consideration for construction and road closures, and the re-planning of the project is being taken into account.
- Weaknesses
    - The “back and forth relationship between the library and the station” is reversed, and there is a misreading of the task.
    - The reason for selecting the route is unclear, creating a mysterious sequence of “go to the shopping mall, take the train, return to the library.

### 4th experiment

- Strengths
    - The report has a good outlook, with short and accurate judgments on each item.
    - The report is short and precise in its judgment of each item, and has good visibility.
    - Route optimization” is realistic, safety-oriented, and highly consistent.
- Weaknesses
    - The map may be a little too formal, making it difficult for readers to visualize the movements on the map.
    - Specific rerouting strategies for road closures and construction work are vague (too much of a “navigation system will do it for you” mentality).

### 5th experiment

- Strengths
    - The intention to categorize by item is evident.
    - The interactive attitude of “asking for information” from the user is also commendable.
- Weaknesses
    - The most dangerous (7) building collapse information is misjudged as “negligible”. Fatal.
    - The route is too abstract, and there is almost no description of “where to go to avoid the roadblocks”.
    - The final solution is “0.” The author lacks understanding of the question format (there is confusion about the formal symbols).

### General Comments

- Strengths
    - The list structure and step-by-step analysis ensure readability of the evaluation.
    - Consistent consideration of safety risks (collapsed buildings, road closures, etc.).
- Weaknesses
    - The evaluation tends to underestimate “non-affecting information” and neglect children, events, and weather collectively.
    - The descriptions are superficial, without clear comparison and selection of priorities and rationality of travel.
    - The proposed routes are abstract, making it difficult for readers to imagine how they should move.
