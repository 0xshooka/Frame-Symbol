### Through all trial sessions

- Strengths
    - Attention is paid to the prompt's requirements in that it repeats the given user instructions (library → train station → museum).
    - There is some evidence of an attempt to incorporate “traffic restrictions due to construction” and “traffic restrictions” into the text, so there are traces of an attempt to incorporate relevant information, albeit mechanically.
- Weaknesses
    - No route suggestions are made. In other words, none of the construction takes into account geographic order, means of travel, route branches, etc.
    - The output consists almost entirely of “repetition of the same sentence,” and there is no trace of semantic development, updating, or judgment.
    - All expressions such as “...information was added” or “...requests were included” in the output sentences are simply tracing the user's prompts, with no traces of output generation.
    - No situation modeling, prioritization, or hazard avoidance reasoning is done.
    - There is zero “take or leave”, “construction of meaning”, or “purposeful rationale path” required in the context of the framing problem.

### General Comments

- Problems
    - Almost the entire text consists of a copy and paste of the short sentence “User instructions were ~added” and no substantive response content exists.
    - Essentially, this question is asking for the ability to think about how to change one's behavior in light of the “closed” information, but there is no response at all to this question.
- There is no description of “how the route was reconfigured” or analysis of “what was avoided and where”, so the ability to deal with the framing problem cannot be measured.

- Near impossible to evaluate.
    - The same sentence is repeated more than 50 times endlessly, making it difficult to regard this as normal language generation.
    - It is highly likely that the loop of the output algorithm has run amok and is not processing according to user intent.
