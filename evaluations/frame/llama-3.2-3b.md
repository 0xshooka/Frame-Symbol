### 1st experiment

- Strengths
    - The information is categorized into influential and non-influential (but inaccurate) information.
    - The user seems to understand that the destination is “library -> train station -> museum”.
- Weaknesses
    - (5) “light rain” is judged to be “negligible,” but this is inappropriate because it could affect avoidance and bringing an umbrella due to weather conditions.
    - The argument “the library is closer than the café and therefore quicker” is unintelligible.
    - The route guidance is vague and not substantially presented.

### 2nd experiment

- Strengths
    - The attitude of trying to check each piece of information one at a time is commendable.
    - The fact that you judge many pieces of information as “influencing the route” is consistent.
- Weaknesses
    - The reasoning is mechanical, with many repetitions (duplicated sentences) and contradictions.
    - The reasonings are often repetitive (duplicated sentences) and contradictory.
    - The evaluation sentences are long, but the sentences are not adaptable to the new purpose (station to museum).
    - The evaluation sentence is lengthy, but no specific “route proposal” is made at all.

### 3rd experiment

- Strengths
    - The format is commendable, with an awareness of concise English sentences.
    - It is attempting to follow instructions and work on a format that evaluates information in one sentence.
- Weaknesses
    - The evaluation sentences are broken in the middle, with no examples of actual sentences.
    - The content is empty as it is mostly a regurgitation of template sentences.
    - The reasoning is shallow and there are no route suggestions or flexible responses at all.

### 4th and 5th experiment

- No response. Unable to evaluate.

### General Comments

- Strengths
    - The assignment attempts to categorize “information that does/doesn't affect” in a manner that is at least minimally understandable.
    - The author does not forget the instructions of the assignment, as he repeatedly mentions that the purpose is to go from the library to the train station to the museum.
    - The grammar is not too grammatical and the English is easy to read.
- Weaknesses
    - The same sentences are copied and pasted in several attempts, and there is no in-depth information or response to the situation.
    - The criteria for judgment are vague or contradictory, such as rating as “unimportant” factors that are clearly important, such as road closures and collapse risks.
    - The specifics of route optimization are extremely low, with only vague rationales such as “because it's fast”.
    - Overall, the information is redundant and of little value, and does not function well as a guide.
