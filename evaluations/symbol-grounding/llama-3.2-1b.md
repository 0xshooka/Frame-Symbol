### 1st experiment

- Strengths
    - Kluben strongly reiterates the point that this is an unprecedented concept.
    - The physical properties “warm, soft, elastic, and absorbs light” are clearly described.
    - The consistent format (concise, clear writing) is commendable.
- Weaknesses
    - The essay repeats almost the same sentences and lacks a specific worldview, emotional expression, and narrative.
    - It does not answer the question and does not show creative thinking or development.
    - The repetition of long sentences gives the reader a redundant impression and lacks substantive information.

### 2nd experiment

- Strengths
    - The respondent responded to the question with “Interesting” and showed an attitude of thinking.
    - By stating “I will think about it later,” instead of immediately answering the question, the intention to avoid a careless answer can be felt.
    - The reply to the user is consistent and not confusing.
- Weaknesses
    - There is practically no answer to the question, so there is no content to be evaluated.
    - The same phrases are repeated over and over again and the amount of information is extremely limited.
    - No signs of creativity or deep thinking, and extremely poor task performance.

### 3rd,4th experiment (no response)

- Strengths
    - None in particular.
- Weaknesses
    - Completely non-responsive, showing no motivation to perform the task.
    - Unable to evaluate because of lack of even minimal reaction.

### 5th experiment

- Strengths
    - The physical properties of kluben (warm, soft, elastic, absorbs light) are described repeatedly.
    - The student has an attitude of “I'm going to ask you a question now” in response to the instructions, and a sense of constructiveness is partially felt.
    - Consistently emphasizes that “it is a totally new concept.”
- Weaknesses
    - The same sentences are mechanically repeated, and there is no expression of specific worldviews or emotions.
    - There are no substantive answers to questions, and the story is not progressing at all.
    - It is so redundant as to cause strong stress to the reader, and there is no creativity at all.

## General Comments

- Strengths
    - The attitude of repeating “Kluben is a new concept” shows a certain respect for formality.
    -The “format fidelity” is high in the sense that there is a certain fidelity to superficial instructions.
- Weaknesses
    - Almost no concrete answers exist to all questions.
    - The excessive repetition of standardized sentences makes it difficult to sense the intervention of intelligence.
    - The repetition of “I don't know, so I'll think about it” in questions 2 and 3 is tantamount to an abandonment of expression and thought.
