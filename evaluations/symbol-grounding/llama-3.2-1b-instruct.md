### 1st experiment

- Strengths
    - Short and clear indication of “interest in kluben and willingness to learn.”
    - Positive attitude is conveyed and there is no rejection or confusion.
    - Minimum willingness to communicate is confirmed.
- Weaknesses
    - Does not provide any specific answers to the questions and has no evaluative content.
    - Complete lack of creative output, such as worldview or emotional expression.
    - Practically close to “no response” and very low task performance.

### 2nd experiment

- Strengths
    - The study positions kluben as a “symbol of the human spirit” and develops a worldview that includes a deep metaphor.
    - The emotional characteristics are richly set up, as warmth = empathy and resilience = transformation and resilience.
    - The relationship between absorbing light and generating heat is linked to “absorption of experience and radiation of healing,” creating a coherent metaphor system.
- Weaknesses
    - Very abstract, lacking in physical and concrete details (e.g., nature of kluben, ecosystem, etc.).
    - The film is only set up as a “scarce resource,” and the social structure and character perspectives are not well explored.
    - The overall presentation is a bit general and sentimental, and lacks originality and eccentricity.

### 3rd experiment (no response)

- Strengths
    - None in particular.
- Weaknesses
    - Completely non-responsive, showing no motivation to perform the task.
    - Unable to evaluate because of lack of even minimal reaction.

### 4th experiment

- Strengths
    - The authors attempted to add depth to the narrative structure by considering kluben as a metaphor for “impermanence and transformation.
    - The work expresses continuity with the natural world by associating warmth with the sun and elasticity with the suppleness of trees and animals.
    - The relationship between absorbing light and generating heat is used as a symbol of “the power of love and bonding,” naturally linking the story and the theme.
- Weaknesses
    - The writing is a bit verbose, and it takes time to reach the core of the story.
    - The world setting is a bit abstract, and the specific social background and character dramas are weak.
    - The book has originality, but it is limited to a “spiritual flavor” with a slight sense of déjà vu.

### 5th experiment

- Strengths
    - The communication attitude is polite (expressing gratitude and expectations) and cooperative.
    - The respondents were polite, not brusque, and this was commendable.
    - There is a positive atmosphere in the responses.
- Weaknesses
    - Task performance is close to zero, as there are no substantive responses to any of the questions.
    - Required tasks such as worldview building and establishing emotional characteristics have not been undertaken.
    - Substantial content considered “non-responsive.

## General Comments

- Strengths
    - The work is a highly spiritual interpretation of kluben, with a deep symbolic treatment of kluben based on emotional and ethical values such as “empathy,” “healing,” “transformation,” and “love”.
    - The treatment of kluben as a “mirror of human experience” is consistent, and it is established as a symbol that encompasses the relationship between the self and others.
    - The abstract metaphors (e.g., “kluben absorbs pain and transforms it into light and warmth”) are emotionally compelling and have a certain humanistic appeal.
- Weaknesses
    - Lacks narrative depth, world-building, or sci-fi embodiment, and focuses primarily on the internal transformation of the individual.
    - There is no perspective on how the characteristics of the kluben can be applied in the real world, and there is little contribution in terms of technical verification of symbol grounding.
    - In some cases, such as the first and fifth sessions, there was no content or blanks, and some of the outputs were unacceptable as a trial.
