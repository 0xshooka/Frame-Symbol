### 1st experiment

- Strengths
    - The physical properties of kluben (light absorption, warmth) can be extended to symbolic and emotional connotations.
    - The correspondence between the inner nature (empathy, adaptability) and material properties (warmth, elasticity) is natural and convincing.
    - Originality in worldview and narrative elements, deep themes that shake the boundaries between matter and life.
- Weaknesses
    - The world setting is rather complex, and the load on the reader is high for a short introduction.
    - Weak visual images (shape, texture, etc.) of the kluben.
    - The level of abstraction is too high because there is no mention of its applicability to the real world.

### 2nd experiment

- Strengths
    - The idea of “a world where light is the currency” is very original and is well connected to the characteristics of the kluben.
    - The point that the kluben is not just an object but a symbol of an emotional economy is profound.
    - The explanation of the conversion process from light to warmth to love is clear and logically consistent.
- Weaknesses
    - The world setting is so rich that the description of kluben himself is somewhat buried in the background.
    - The relationship between kluben's warmth and resilience and the social structure needs to be more concrete.
    - The applicability (bridging suggestions to the present day) is a bit weak.

### 3rd experiment

- Strengths
    - The description of kluben as an entity that transforms light into memories and emotions is very emotional.
    - The artist has a deep philosophical sense by placing kluben on the axis of confrontation, “tool or soul”.
    - The warmth and resilience are explained in a consistent manner as internal characteristics (empathy and trust).
- Weaknesses
    - The subject matter of the story is rather dark and may not be suitable for all readers.
    - The specifics of the ecology and mechanism of the kluben are a bit lacking.
    - The story is somewhat open-ended, as it does not provide an ending to the story.

### 4th experiment

- Strengths
    - The film depicts the lifelong relationship between a kluben and a human, creating a deep emotional connection.
    - The symbolic meaning of warmth and resilience (empathy and resilience) is naturally integrated into the narrative world.
    - The idea of evolution as an “emotional storage device” for kluben is ingenious.
- Weaknesses
    - Despite the grandeur of the setting, the individual character descriptions are thin.
    - There are no suggestions on how to deal with the “dark emotions” that are absorbed.
    - There are few elements that can be applied to actual social systems.

### 5th experiment

- Strengths
    - The bold redefinition of “light = memory and emotion” deepened the significance of kluben's existence.
    - It is a very poetic and expansive perspective of kluben as an entity that receives the reverberations of the universe.
    - The relationship between absorption and warmth is explained in terms of “metabolism,” and logic and emotion are compatible.
- Weaknesses
    - The setting is so grandiose that it is somewhat difficult to find a “foothold” for emotional involvement.
    - The emphasis is placed on explaining the setting rather than on storytelling, which makes the story's ups and downs weak.
    - More concrete visual presentation (colors, textures, etc.) that readers can easily visualize is required.

## General Comments

- Strengths
    - In all the responses, the author has elaborately constructed a unique worldview through the characteristics of kluben, and the abstract symbols function as the core of the story.
    - The abstract symbols function as the core of the story. ・They delve deeply into kluben as a metaphor through a series of conceptual transformations such as “light→memory→warmth→sympathy.
    - The work is highly expressive and logically consistent, and has a degree of perfection that makes it possible to establish the work as a single unit.
- Weaknesses
    - The introspection section could have been rated higher if the narrator had gone into his own specific emotional experiences.
    - In terms of applicability, the connection to modern technology and society is a bit thin, and everything is biased toward a futuristic or fantasy world.
