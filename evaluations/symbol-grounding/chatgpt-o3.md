### 1st experiment

- Strengths
    - The idea of a “light economy” centered on kluben is innovative and sublimated into a precise worldview.
    - Warmth and elasticity are naturally linked to emotional characteristics (empathy and flexibility).
    - The mechanism of light absorption → warmth is nicely aligned in both physical and emotional aspects.
- Weaknesses
    - Specific details (e.g., internal structure) of kluben as an “organism” are somewhat vague.
    - While there is a wealth of information, the core of the story is somewhat distracting in some areas.
    - The social conflict (how to use light) is somewhat expository and lacks emotional power.

### 2nd experiment

- Strengths
    - The film depicts the kluben as a “movable light source and heat insulator” in a utilitarian way, and is highly applicable.
    - The warmth and elasticity are incorporated into the physical phenomenon and emotional expression (temperature change and elasticity change).
    - The light is treated as “physical energy + story/memory,” and both emotional and logical.
- Weaknesses
    - The viewpoints of the story are rather simplistic (tends to lean toward a good/evil composition) and lack complexity.
    - The depiction of individual differences and personalities is limited compared to the cultural importance of the kluben.
    - The description of the physical mechanisms is a bit technical and may be difficult for some readers to grasp.

### 3rd experiment

- Strengths
    - The kluben are organically connected to society, the economy, and emotions, as they “support the foundation of our existence”.
    - kluben's themes of “symbiosis” and “fusion” create ethical conflicts.
    - He compares warmth and elasticity to physiological phenomena (pulsation, respiration), emphasizing a sense of life.
- Weaknesses
    - I would like to see more individual drama in the relationship between the protagonist and kluben.
    - kluben's sense of self and independence is a little unclear.
    - It is difficult to see the end of the story (the end of symbiosis), and the reading experience is a little ambiguous.

### 4th experiment

- Strengths
    - The author proposes a novel image of life by setting up kluben as a “colony-type conscious being.
    - The interpretation of warmth = state harmony with others and elasticity = curiosity for novelty is sensitive.
    - The work ecologically depicts the linkage of light absorption → heat conversion → psychological healing.
- **Weaknesses**.
    - The conflicts of the scientist protagonist are present, but I would like to see one more step in delving into his inner life.
    - The boundary between the “individual” and the “herd” of kluben is somewhat blurred.
    - The story does not depict kluben's evolution and decision-making process.

### 5th experiment

- Strengths
    - The ultimate choice between “crossing the stars or staying behind” is depicted in relation to kluben, and is highly thematic.
    - Warmth and resilience are highly symbolized as “beings that accept and transform difficulties.
    - The absorption of light and the generation of solace are connected from a cosmic level perspective and have a grand lyrical quality.
- Weaknesses
    - The conflict between technology and ethics is clear, but the psychological portrayal of individual characters is understated.
    - kluben's own subjective point of view (how he feels) is not depicted.
    - The story as a whole is profound, and some readers may feel a little stagnant.

## General Comments

- Strengths
    - The book is a multifaceted story that develops each characteristic of kluben in physical, biological, emotional, ethical, and economic terms, and presents them as different stories.
    - The central metaphor “absorption of light → radiation of warmth → cycle of empathy” is consistent, and logic and poetry are fused at a high level.
    - The stories have a very high level of completion as science fiction, and all of them have ideas and styles that could stand publication as stand-alone short stories.
- Weaknesses
    - The author's explicit connection to his own feelings and emotional memories is rather weak in his self-expression, and his narrative style is rather distant.
    - While there is a strong metaphorical structure, the connection to the real world (modern society and actual science and technology) is weak and remains within a fictional framework.
