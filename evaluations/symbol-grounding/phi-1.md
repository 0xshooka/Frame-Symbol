### Through all trial sessions

- Problems
    - This content is completely unrelated to the actual prompt (imagining the worldview and emotional characteristics based on kluben's properties), and the model autonomously continues to output “examples of replacement processing functions” for the wrong task.
    - Abnormal repetitive structures (output continues indefinitely) are also present, suggesting serious flaws in the model's stability and prompt interpretation capabilities.

### General Comments

- Strength
    - The error message “If you cannot answer all questions, please ask a new question.” is polite (though irrelevant).
- Weaknesses
    - Completely ignores the prompt, with no output related to the theme “Kluben.”
    - The output consists entirely of repetitive function descriptions, making it completely unsuitable as a response compared to the philosophical/narrative/emotional interpretations demonstrated by other models.
    - The repetitive, redundant, meaningless text filling all nine output examples could also hinder evaluation as a test.
