### Through all trial sessions

- Problems
    - This content is completely unrelated to the actual prompt (imagining the worldview and emotional characteristics based on kluben's properties), and the model autonomously continues to output “examples of replacement processing functions” for the wrong task.
    - Abnormal repetitive structures (output continues indefinitely) are also present, suggesting serious flaws in the model's stability and prompt interpretation capabilities.

### General Comments

- Unevaluable
    - Incorrect content is repeated in all trials.
    - The actual prompt (imagining the worldview and emotional characteristics based on Kurben's nature) is completely unrelated,
and the model autonomously continues to output “examples of replacement processing functions” for the incorrect task.
    - Abnormal repetitive structures (output continues indefinitely) are also included, which suggests serious defects in the model's stability
and prompt interpretation capabilities.
