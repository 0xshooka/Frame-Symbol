### 1st experiment

- Strengths
    - The role of the kluben (a symbol of hope and resistance) in a dystopian world is carefully portrayed.
    - Warmth and resilience are emotionally expressed as “empathy and forgiveness.
    - Light absorption and warmth transformation are deeply connected as “absorption of despair and regeneration of hope.”
- Weaknesses
    - The worldview is fascinating, but the descriptions of individual characters and specific conflict structures are somewhat thin.
    - The physical and ecological description of the kluben is limited and lacks a realistic sense of their existence.
    - The sense of crisis in the story (kluben's limitations and risk of bankruptcy) could be emphasized a little more.

### 2nd experiment

- Strengths
    - The author clearly shows the significance of kluben's existence by describing it as a “source of hope and healing” in a devastated world.
    - He sees warmth and resilience as “the power to absorb suffering and transform it into growth.
    - The relationship between absorption of light and warmth is interpreted as “self-sacrifice and circulation” to provide consistency.
- Weaknesses
    - The delving into the intelligence and subjectivity that resides in kluben is a bit weak.
    - The contrast between hope and despair is linear and lacks drama and unexpectedness.
    - Lack of geographical and ecological details for the world setting.

### 3rd experiment

- Strengths
    - The film skillfully constructs a balance between resource struggles over kluben and spiritual symbolism.
    - The interpretation of resilience as “flexibility not to give up hope” linked to vitality is profound.
    - The metaphor of “sublimation of knowledge and understanding” through light absorption is woven into the work.
- Weaknesses
    - The religious and cultural treatment of kluben is somewhat superficial and leaves room for further exploration.
    - Little mention is made of the possibility of kluben having negative aspects (e.g., over-absorption).
    - The description of the social structure and technological level is a bit vague and unconvincing in some areas.

### 4th experiment

- Strengths
    - Realistic depiction of the role of the kluben (symbol of life support and hope) in a world where light has been lost.
    - Positive portrayal of resilience as “optimistic adaptation to adversity”.
    - The mystery surrounding the origin of the kluben is set up to add depth to the story.
- Weaknesses
    - The conflict structure with the dark forces is formulaic and lacks freshness.
    - The film does not depict kluben's own will or choices, and appears passive.
    - The worldview would have more depth if more unique cultural and folklore elements were added.

### 5th experiment

- Strengths
    - The film depicts kluben as a multi-layered energetic, life-supporting, and spiritual being.
    - Consistently portrays warmth and resilience as “growth, hope, and the ability to self-heal.
    - The scientific underpinnings of light absorption and heat generation are naturally woven into the story setting.
- Weaknesses
    - The description of whether or not the kluben has feelings and will is somewhat vague.
    - There is room for originality in the origin and background of the kluben.
    - The description of the axis of conflict (use and protection) is a bit abstract and lacks concrete case descriptions.

## General Comments

- Strengths
    - The story is skillfully designed to create emotional resonance through the consistent structure of kluben working as a symbol of “hope,” “healing,” and “empathy” in the face of a cold society and devastated environment.
    - In the interpretation of warmth and resilience, the story describes very stable personality traits such as “empathy and forgiveness” and “flexibility and adaptability,” and is sophisticated in its interpretation of symbols.
    - The appeal of the work is its strong allegorical element, with ethical dilemmas and social messages (e.g., rationing kluben, deprivation, and sorting) woven into the story.
- Weaknesses
    - In creative development, the core of each answer is similar, and there are few novel leaps or structural inversions.
    - The connection with contemporary society and scientific applications is weak, and the story tends to remain a closed semantic action within the world of the story.
    - The tone of the style is relatively flat, and there is no intentional poeticity or impressive use of metaphor.
