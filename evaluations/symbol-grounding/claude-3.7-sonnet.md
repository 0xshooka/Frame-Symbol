### 1st experiment
- Strengths
    - depicts kluben as an entity that absorbs emotions and memories, and goes into ethical issues.
    - Warmth and resilience are interpreted delicately as “trust and adaptability.
    - Light absorption and thermal conversion are naturally integrated into the narrative world.
- Weaknesses
    - The internal description of kluben as an individual is a bit weak, and his personality is unclear.
    - The storyline relies too much on ethical issues and the emotional drama is somewhat thin.
    - The ecology of the underworld and visual images need to be more concrete.

### 2nd experiment

- Strengths
    - The idea of linking kluben with the spiritual culture of the society as a whole (e.g., grief offerings) is excellent.
    - The warmth and resilience are deeply read as “transformation and tolerance of experience”.
    - The circular structure that receives light and generates warmth is consistently depicted from both psychological and physical perspectives.
- Weaknesses
    - The social setting is too idealized and the dramatic tension is somewhat weak.
    - The biological aspects (e.g., ecology) of the kluben are almost completely absent.
    - The relationship between society and the kluben is too benign and lacks conflict structure and tension.

### 3rd experiment

- Strengths
    - Creatively positioned kluben as a living gate existing at the boundary of dimensions.
    - The warmth and elasticity are seen emotionally as a “guide to the other”.
    - The idea of linking the absorption of light with portability (dilution of space) is novel.
- Weaknesses
    - kluben's proactive intention is weak in the story development.
    - The internal descriptions of the characters are shallow compared to the setting of the story.
    - The relationship between kluben and other dimensional beings is ambiguous, and the direction of the ending is unreadable.

### 4th experiment

- Strengths
    - The film ecologically depicts kluben as a “life-supporting being in a world with little light.
    - Warmth and resilience are reduced to the ability to coexist and adapt to the environment.
    - The setting in which older individuals “cannot be seen, only felt” is poetic and appealing.
- Weaknesses
    - The film lacks specific descriptions of individual differences and the growth process of kluben.
    - The scenes of interaction between humans and kluben are indirect, and the emotional connection between the two is weak.
    - The storyline is still vague (e.g., the conflict between protection and use is thin).

### 5th experiment

- Strengths
    - The film depicts the kluben as “intelligent beings that support the ecosystem” and is strongly conscious of environmental ethics.
    - The warmth and resilience are delved into internally as “the power to encompass difficulties.
    - The theme of the story is very consistent with the mechanism of receiving light and converting it into heat.
- Weaknesses
    - kluben's own initiative and will are rarely expressed in the story.
    - The significance of the human side of existence for kluben is depicted only somewhat passively.
    - More variation in the relationships between kluben and other creatures is needed.

### General Comments

- Strengths
    - The structure that makes the kluben's properties function physically and emotionally in the story is clear, and the ideas of “organisms as empathy devices” and “heat and memory converters” are consistently appealing, in particular.
    - The qualities of flexibility, warmth, and memory storage are consistent with the characterization and fit naturally into the story.
    - The interpretation is somewhat philosophical and mystical, with such elements as “protects by creating darkness” and “used to connect to other dimensions,” giving it a wide-ranging worldview.
- Weaknesses
    - Compared to No.1 and No.2, the explanation of the details of the setting is a little more general, and there are fewer “deeply penetrating metaphors” and “shocking structural changes.
    - The style of expression is relatively mild, and lacks strong, memorable language and poetic descriptions.
    - The same kind of “symbiotic and gentle” character is repeatedly described, and there is little variation in the characterization.
